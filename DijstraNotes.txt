predecessors is a map from town to town
distance is a map from town to int


put just adds a value to the map
so add the first town, and dist 0
add the town to the unsettled towns

the loop ends when it gets to 0
	get the closest town
	add it to settledTowns
	remove the node from unSettledtowns

A node is moved to the settled set if a shortest path from the source to this node has been found.



The current town had a list of outgoing routes and each route can tell you what it's destinations is

And is you're following the sequence in a list, you deal with the first item, remove it (put it somewhere else if required) and deal with the new first item in the list and so on
